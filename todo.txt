1. Read up about HTTP keep-alive and how it is used to reuse back end connections until the timeout expires. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection) [DONE]

1.1. refactor the code into multiple files if needed.

2. Add some Logging - think about the kinds of things that would be useful for a developer, i.e. which server did a clientâ€™s request go to, how long did the backend server take to process the request and so on. [DONE]

3. Build some automated tests that stand up the backend servers, a load balancer and a few clients. Check the load balancer can handle multiple clients at the same time.

4. If you opted for threads, try converting it to use an async framework - or vice versa. (maybe use BullMQ)
